## About

I have been a computer enthusiast my entire life.  My career has varied greatly over the years.  I have worked on networks, desktops/laptops, servers, and am currently working primarily as a software developer.  I enjoy playing with different sytems.  I use both Linux and Windows systems.  Professionally most of my software tends to lean in the .Net C# area; however,  I develop many side projects that include more Linux friendly technology stacks.  I have and can write software in many different languages including C#, VB.net, PHP, Python, C++, Java, JavaScript/Node.js, and many more.  I am constantly learning.  I have a bachelor's degree in information technology.  I recently got admitted to Georgia Tech for a master's degree in computer science.
