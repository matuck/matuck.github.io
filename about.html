## About

<img class="roundborderpic floatimageleft" src="/img/me2.jpeg" width="200px"/> I have been a computer enthusiast my entire life.  My career has varied greatly over the years.  I have worked on networks, desktops/laptops, servers, and as a software developer.  I enjoy playing with different sytems.  I use both Linux and Windows systems.  I have and can write software in many different languages including C#, VB.net, PHP, Python, C++, Java, JavaScript/Node.js, and many more.  I am constantly learning.  I have a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.  I am currently waiting on conferral of Master of Science in Inforation Technology: Information Assurance and Security. I am in the process of obtain Redhat certifications.  I currently hold MCSE, A+, Network+, and Security+ certifcations.

I have a large family.  I am married with six boys.  There is a twelve year age bag between the oldest and youngest boys.  Three of my boys are on the Autism Spectrum.  One of the boys has ARFID which is a rare eating disorder.  My house is never quite, and there is always something to do with so many people in the house.

Aside from computers and family I have a few other hobbies.  The biggest hobby I have is riding motorcycles.  I am currently riding a 2021 Road Glide Special in snake venom.I love to ride, but riding time is always limited.  Most of my riding times consists of commuting back and forth to work.  I am also an amateur radio operator (ham).  My callsign is AI4ON.  I am not very active.  This is mostly due to the limited time.
