These things are complete junk.  I went out to the Bronco and slid the bottom piece in place.  I started trying to clip on the top piece and I could not get it to clip together.  I tried for a good bit at this point.  I eventually removed from the car.  I then tried to get this put together without installing.  I know I would have to take back apart to install, but I thought if I could see how they went together.  No matter what I tried I could not get them together.  The clips do not extend down far enough.  They did not look like everything lined up properly.
