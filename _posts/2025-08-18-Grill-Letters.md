I love my Bronco but the all white and black needed some color.  I purchased the TUF Skins grill letters to give a little color to my build.  I absolutely love the way this turned out.  It added some much needed color to the Bronco.  The install was easy.  I first dry fitted each letter to make sure it fit.  Then simply pully the back of the tape and stick on.  I did have to pull back loose immediately a time or two to realign the letter.  This definately adds some character.
