<img class="floatimageleft" src="/img/apu.png" width="200px"/>College has been a long journey for me. I started college right after highschool.  I attended for roughly a year.  At that time I stopped going and decided college was not for me.  I continued working and trying to break into the IT field.  I completed several computer certifications, and eventually landed my first IT job.

I worked for Shaw Industries for about 10 years.  I help several positions at Shaw growing my career.  After 10 years Shaw layed me off (as well as many others).  I had difficulty finding a job at that time.  Everywhere I went they wanted a college degree.  I deviced to go back to school.  This was going to be a difficult task though, as I had a family now.  I needed something that was going to be flexible with my schedule.  I eventually chose an online school, American Public University.  

My undergraduate work I thought was rather easy.  This is probably due to having so much experience in the field already.  I completed my bachelor's degree in about two and a half years.  This seemed to allieviate alot of the problems I had finding a job.  During this process I also found out I did not mind school as much as I had previously.  The online method of school works out much better for me than a traditional brick and morter school.

At this point I decieded to continue on to get a masters degree.  I orignally enrolled at Georgia Tech.  I had a great time there though it was short.  I had personal things that came up in life that did not allow me to concentrate on my school work.  After things setteled down in life I reenrolled at American Public Unviversity.  I discovered that this work was not as easy as my undergrad school work.  I had to write many more and much longer papers.  I made it my capstone class.  I did not complete my capstone class on my first attempt.  Completing a capton thesis or project is a very time consuming task, and I was a little burnt out on school.  I took about a year off, and then made my second attempt at this class.  I did not find this class any easier this time around, but I had a fresh mind going into it.  I did get frustrated at times, but the class is now complete.  I have now completed everything needed for my degree.  I am just waiting on the University on conferral of the degree.

I have to say to those that are thinking about going for the degree good luck and stay determined.

As or right now I am not looking to go for a doctorate degree.  I may change my mind later.  This is not the end of my learning though.  I am planning to continue on with computer certifications.  I am also entertaining the idea of becoming a college professor.
