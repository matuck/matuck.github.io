This is a post to cover miscleanous interior install.  My reasoning for each piece.

## Door Handle storage
I am constantly trying to put my phone in the door handle slot, and of course my phone falls through because there is no bottom to the door handle.  These solve that problem.  They are a simple installed peel the tape and slide in.  One thing I would recommend is to dry fit before installing each, one because it does mater for side and front or rear.  Another recommendation is to keep the tape pulled away from the edge until you have it fully in then push firmly against the side.

## Rear Seat back covers
I have rubber mats all over the Bronco.  I also have a white dog who never gets in the Bronco, but somehow his fur always seems to find a way in.  I got these to help protect the back of the seats and to help make it easier to get the dog fur out.  They look great in the Bronco and serve the purpose.

## LED Interior Dome Lights
The stock interior light is abismal.  These light up the interior nicely.  The install is pretty straight forward.  Remove the rear interior lamp. Push wiring harness through the top and plugin.  Losen or remove trim pieces and route cable around the side of vehicles.  Attach the lights with the stock trim bolts and plugin to the wiring harness you routed around.

## 1" Ball Adapter
This is a ball I can attach my ram mount or other items to.  I also added a quick release to this so I can use my Insta360 in the same spot quickly.

## Tailgate Table Foldable Molle
I wanted a place to store things like tools and my first aid kit, and free up my glove box.  This worked perfectly.  My glove box is now empty for me to store other things like my sunshade.  It was a fairly quick install and it has some t-nuts that tighten down in slots to attach to tailgate.  It is a fairly quick install.

## Windshield Sun Shade
The Bronco gets hot when it is parked.  This helps keep it a little cooler and protect the interior from some UV rays.  This sunshade it built specfically for the Bronco so it fits nicely.

## Auxilary Switch Labels
I have only put on 2 labels so far.  I put one label for the stock front lights, and one label for my ham/gmrs radio.  I will add other labels as I wire up addtional items to the AUX switches.  These are white, and are easily readable on the AUX Switches.

## Center Console organizer
We were on a ride with the top out, and had the phone in the wireless charger.  The phone over heated from being directly in the sun, and on the wireless charger.  This is a little tray that goes in the center console with a pass through for wires.  I plugged in a 12v usb charger and passed a cable through.  This keeps my phone out of the sun, and allows me to keep charging.  I am also able to add a little organization to my center console.

## Magnetic Sunglasses Holder
There is no stock place to hold sunglasses in the Bronco.  This comes in a set of two and attaches to the visor.
