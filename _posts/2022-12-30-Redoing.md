Considering I never done anything with the site the last time I redid it, why am I redoing it again?  Well alot has changed since then.  Many life changes.  I plan to use this more.  I have much I would like to write about so I have revamped everything.

I look forward todating this and keeping things updated.  I have plenty of education things I would like to write on.  I also am wanting to write some about motorcycles and family.  Stay tune!
