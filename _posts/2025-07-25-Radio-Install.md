The Radioditty QB25 I have had, and was moved from another vehicle.  All of the other parts are new.  I chose a radio like this because I can use it for both GMRS and HAM.  Because I chose the wrong antenna cable I had to module the antenna mount.  If you pick the correct antenna mount and cable, this will be much easier.  I ran power and antenna through rubber gromet on firewall near the top of driver side.  I routed cables across to the other side of the vehicle.  I mounted the radio to the center console molle panel.  I was not able to use the stock screws on the passenger grab handle to mount the molle panel.  The stock screws were to short.  I replaced these with some black m6 allen head screws. I wired the radio to the Aux6 switch.  I chose to run the power under the good instead of using the power wire behind the glove box.  I thought I could save this wire for something else since I was already running an antenna wire.  I am not 100% sold on the antenna.  It seems to do fine on the 440 range, but 2m/144 range soes not seem to pick up as well.  I will continue to evaluate but it may be replaced.
I chagned the stock radio antenna to the short 7" antenna.  This was a really simple install. All that has to be done was unscrew the stock and antenna and screw on the new one.
